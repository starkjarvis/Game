Future scope would be:
1. Making project less hard-coded. (at some place JDBC is done directly to save time)
2. Making UI better and more interactive.
3. Using different types of files (audio, video) for the game.
4. Make response speed more faster.
5. Using connection pooling to avoid creating new connection everytime.
6. Make more than 2 players play at a time.
